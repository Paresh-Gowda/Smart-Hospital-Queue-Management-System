# üè• SwiftQ ‚Äî Smart Hospital Queue 

SwiftQ is a smart hospital queue management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It automates patient token generation, displays live queue updates, and dynamically manages priority or emergency cases.
The system ensures smooth patient flow, reduces waiting times, and provides real-time updates for hospital staff and patients through an intuitive, hospital-friendly interface.

Designed with a clean and spacious UI/UX, SwiftQ features live countdown timers, automatic next-patient calls, and persistent queue data using browser LocalStorage. 
Its calm blue theme and card-based layout reflect a modern hospital environment, combining professionalism with ease of use.
The system includes features like search, filtering, emergency simulation, and re-queuing ‚Äî all in a single-page application.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of frontend logic, user experience design, and real-time data handling.
While it currently runs as a demo, SwiftQ has strong potential for real-world hospital use by integrating databases, IoT display boards, or notification systems.
It demonstrates how technology can simplify hospital management and enhance patient experience effectively.
