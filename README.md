# üè• SwiftQ ‚Äî Smart Hospital Queue

SwiftQ is an interactive hospital queue management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It automates patient token generation, displays a live queue, and dynamically manages priority and emergency cases, ensuring smoother patient flow and reduced waiting times.
The interface is designed with a hospital-friendly card layout, color-coded indicators, and a modern blue theme for clarity and usability.

The system features real-time Now Serving updates with countdown timers, animated progress bars, and interactive controls for calling, promoting, or removing patients.
All served or removed patients are recorded in a history page, and the daily patient count is automatically synced with the history.
Users can search for tokens, simulate emergencies, and clear the queue or history, which also resets the daily totals.

SwiftQ demonstrates practical frontend logic, real-time data handling, and UX-focused design.
While it currently runs in the browser using LocalStorage for persistence, it has strong potential for real-world hospital use through backend integration, IoT display boards, or notification systems.
This project showcases how technology can simplify hospital management and improve patient experience efficiently.
